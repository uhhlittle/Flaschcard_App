## Project 1 Rubric:
- to achieve a 2 in this category
### Software Production: 1
- program is functional
- no major errors
- to achieve a 2 in this category, you would need to fix being able to only play a quiz once. Maybe introduce a third model that could not only track your games, but also save state. Maybe, an aswer object? You could also incorporate a user model, that could have many transactions

### Code Quality: 1
- overall code quality is good
- there's a couple minor indentation/white space issues but nothing major.
- to achieve a 2 in this category, you would need to abstract some logic from the main application and wrap them into the class definitions. You could potentially create a user interface class as well to abstract the UI from the main application as well.

### Associations: 1
- you have a one to many association in Active Record
- you are correctly implementing the association for CRUD
- to achieve a 2 in this category, you must incorporate a third model, maybe an answer model, or a user model and use those associations to your advantage

### Tests : 1
- you have created a test! congratulations
- to achieve a 2 in this category, i would definitely incorporate so more tests into your solution. Think of really easy ones at first like, whether a new object is nil or not. Create that test, and than start being more explicit and verbose with the tests.

### Documentation: 2
- even though you didn't incorporate setup into your documentation, you still have a lot of good content for documentation
- clear user stories, though look at my comments for user stories in that file
- ERD included, look into doing ERD's through a website like gliffy.
- to get a real 2 in this category, include set up instructions for your application.
